But sometimes it can be a real challenge to take tools and projects developed internally and open-source them, especially from a traditional enterprise. Guest Aaron Rinehart shares his journey and story with open sourcing his internal security chaos engineering tool, Chaoslingr.

&amp;ldquo;You will eventually get to CPU, memory, and disk, but a lot later after you start with the things you should really care about&amp;rdquo; - James</description>

      <description>Retro Trevor completed another revolution around the sun. Got Chromecasts for some family members. He was really impressed with how easily it interfaced with their other devices. Matt celebrated the holidays and got a lot of Doctor Who stuff, including a new Sonic Screwdriver that his 4 year old sons are obsessed with. He also got the first part of his new tattoo done. And lots of PowerShell, cloud, and DevOps.</description>

      <description>Things get off to a great start during the retro, where Trevor complains about destroying his USB 3.0 drivers due to a Win 8.1 upgrade and Matt turns into a Cylon.
Test Kitchen is now officially 1.0, but does’t really support Windows, but that doesn’t stop Matt from wanting to hack it to make it work anyway.

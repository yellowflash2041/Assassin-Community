experiments:
  follow_implicit_points: # Points given for implicit tag weights
    # TEST FINISHED
    # Hypotheses: Weighting tags based on implied preference will lead
    # to more repeat engagement.
    # Recommended duration: 4 weeks (ending at start of January)

    # OUTCOME:
    # It was observed that "base" has been consistently ahead in comments and
    # "four hours of article reads in day" by 10% to 20% over no_implicit_score
    # but over time this began regressing towards the mean and seeming more random.
    # In inspecting the ways we are measuring goals here, anything with a low barrier
    # will eventually be reached (aka leave one reaction) by most users, so over time
    # these goals demonstrate less value.
    # So this test is being cut off on the observation of a clear winner early on
    # with the note that we need tests which can map better to the duration of the test.

    # This experiment is no longer running in production, but can remain configured here
    # while there are no other experiments running.

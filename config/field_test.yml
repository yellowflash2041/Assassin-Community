    # This tests how we fetch "globally hot articles" â€” Testing some variants of
    # more focus on the particpant's tags, some other alternatives which take more into account
    # when the particpant was last on the site and viewed a post.
    # -> Recommended experiment duration: 2 weeks.
    # This experiment has new goals measuring consistently of coming back and clocking a page view
    # and two weeks should be enough to see results.
    # Hypotheses. This will be more impactful than past experiments which were too modest.
    # We'll get more info on bigger levers on experiments, and should be able to pit the winner
    # against some more variation.
    # combination_only_tags_followed_and_top_max_7_days will be interesting to observe I think.

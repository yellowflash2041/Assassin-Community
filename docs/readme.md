# Welcome to Forem's developer documentation

On this site you'll find instructions to setup a [local instance of
Forem][installation], documentation on the [architecture of
Forem][architecture], [how to contribute][contributing], and many other useful
documents.

This documentation site is the product of a number of volunteer contributors
working alongside the Forem Core Team, special thanks to all those who have
contributed to the documentation.

# Running the documentation locally

Like Forem, this site is open source and the code is [hosted on GitHub][docs].
If you find any incorrect information, or a even a typo, we'd love to see a pull
request. Follow these steps to get the documentation site running locally.

Forem's documentation is built with [GitDocs NodeJS library][gitdocs].

To start the gitdocs server, you should run `yarn gitdocs serve` from the root
of the `forem` project or from the `/docs` directory.

```shell
yarn gitdocs serve
```

This will start a server where you can browse the documentation:
<http://localhost:8000/>

If you add new pages or rename existing pages, you'll need to restart the server
for those changes to take effect.

# Contributing to the docs

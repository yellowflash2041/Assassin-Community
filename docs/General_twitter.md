# Twitter

The Twitter account is the voice and there are ways to do it well, types of tweets, etc.

### Medium and language agnostic topics
- Ethics of software
- Encryption
- Databases
- Trivia



### Classifying types of tweets

- Classic on-brand jokes (ORLY covers)
- Silliness (play on words)
- Interesting tidbits/oddities, like a fascinating Stack Overflow question
- Great articles on programming culture (and not so much the greater tech culture)
- On point criticisms, there is a real bar here though. It can be too easy to devolve into useless "think piece" land when being critical.
- Programming news that has broad appeal (releases of fascinating OSS and APIs)
- Fun interactions with other Twitter people
- Polls are fucking sweet.
- Fascinating GitHub projects
- Funny little interactions with notable characters. Asking stupid questions. Nothing insulting.
- Text screenshots from Hacker News, Reddit, etc.
  - Could be money but needs to be done with care.
- Tweet storms are great if natural and on point. Don't get too happy with them.
- Insightful or funny quotes

### Keys

- Keep it balanced. Don't be too ridiculous without stabling off to seriousness.
- Try new things and pay attention to the results
- Keep a general narrative up. Nothing lives on its own.
- Cynicism is fun but don't be too much of a downer.
- Learn from new things and take notes of what works but stay grounded to the core, centered line. Stay true to the origins in some sort of way while also asking, how can this be better? Like a TV show with existing fans but the creative latitude to let the characters evolve.

### The future

- Twitter is great but it's somewhat limited and also not a platform we can rely on. We must diversify and ultimately bring the same magic of Twitter onto our platform if we can.
- Extend what we can do with Twitter including more private messaging with users. Right now we have lots of DM convos but it's hard to scale that in the current setup. If we can scale up the number of private convos we are having with people we can draw a lot of power from that.

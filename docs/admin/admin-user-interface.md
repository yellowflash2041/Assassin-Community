title: Admin User Interface

# User Interface

Our admin dashboard is primarily ERB views that render on the server. Largely,
we try to adhere to
[ActionView](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_view_overview.html)'s
conventions in these views.

For layout, basic styles, and some interactions, we use
[Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/). Forem isn't dedicated to using
Bootstrap for everything, but because our design team hasn't spent much time on
these views, we find it's easier to stick with something many developers already
know.

When a view requires some custom interactivity, we've historically leaned on
vanilla JavaScript or jQuery, but going forward we've elected to use
[StimulusJS](https://stimulusjs.org/) for DOM manipulation and interactivity
inside of admin.

# Forms

Inside of the admin views, we're
[actively moving from the old ERB syntax for forms](https://m.patrikonrails.com/rails-5-1s-form-with-vs-old-form-helpers-3a5f72a8c78a).
We tend to prefer the `form_with` helper over the previous `form_for` and
`form_tag` helpers.

# StimulusJS

Stimulus is a modest frontend framework; its primary purpose is manipulating
HTML. It does not provide templating features.

In the Forem application, [Webpacker](/frontend/webpacker/) is used to load
Stimulus controllers. Ideally, controllers serve as an abstraction for shared
functionality between views.

New controllers can be added in `/app/javascript/admin/controllers`. Unit tests
should exist for each controller in the adjacent
`/app/javascript/admin/__tests__/contollers` directory.

# Pusher for Realtime Notifications

Pusher is a third party service being used to power the [chat system](https://dev.to/connect).

In order to use the chat functionality within your development environment,
you will need to sign up for a free-tier Pusher account and retrieve
its keys. Then you'll need to provide those keys to the Rails application.

1. [Sign up](https://dashboard.pusher.com/accounts/sign_up) or [sign in](https://dashboard.pusher.com/) to your Pusher account.

2. Once signed in, fill in the prompt to create a new Pusher Channels app.

3. In your new Pusher Channels app, click the "App Keys" tab.

4. Change your keys accordingly (name of Pusher key -> name of our application key):

   ```text
   app_id -> PUSHER_APP_ID
   key -> PUSHER_KEY
   secret -> PUSHER_SECRET
   cluster -> PUSHER_CLUSTER
   ```

5. Done.

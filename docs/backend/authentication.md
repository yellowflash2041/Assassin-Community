# Authentication

Authentication is handled by [Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise)
and [OmniAuth](https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth).

On Forem you can only authenticate through GitHub or Twitter. Please check out
the respective guides on how to authenticate:

- [Facebook authentication](/backend/auth-facebook)
- [Github authentication](/backend/auth-github)
- [Twitter authentication](/backend/auth-twitter)

We may add other authentication providers in the future. Please check back
again, or search
[our GitHub repository's issues.](https://github.com/forem/forem/issues)

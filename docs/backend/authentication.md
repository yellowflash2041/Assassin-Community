# Authentication

Authentication is handled by [Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise) and [OmniAuth](https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth).

On DEV you can only authenticate through GitHub or Twitter. Please check out the respective guides on how to authenticate:

- [Github authentication](/backend/auth-github)
- [Twitter authentication](/backend/auth-twitter)

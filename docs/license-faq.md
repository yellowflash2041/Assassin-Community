Like many open source projects, we require that contributors provide us with a Contributor License Agreement (CLA).  By submitting code to the DEV project, you are granting us a right to use that code under the terms of the CLA.
 
Our version of the CLA was adapted from the Microsoft Contributor License Agreement, which they generously made available to the public domain under Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal.

### Where can I learn more about the AGPL-3 license?

Please refer to the official “[Why the Affero GPL](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-affero-gpl.html)” and the [FAQ page](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html) on [GNU.org](https://www.gnu.org) for full details regarding this license.

### Why does DEV have a CLA?

The Contributor License Agreement (CLA) is a legal document in which you state that you are entitled to contribute your code to the DEV codebase, and are willing to have it used in distributions and derivative work.

The CLA helps provide confidence to future users that they will be allowed to use the DEV codebase without fear that a contributor will try to withdraw permissions at a later date.

### Am I giving away the copyright of my contributions?

No. You are granting DEV a license to use and distribute your contribution without further restriction, not assigning the copyright.

### What if I have other questions?

# Frequently Asked Questions

## How do I fix the Error `role "ec2-user" does not exist` on an AWS instance?

After installing and configuring PostgreSQL on an AWS EC2 (or AWS Cloud9) instance and running `bin/setup`, this error could occur.

To fix it, run the following two commands in a terminal (assuming your PostgreSQL user is named **postgres**):

```
sudo -u postgres createuser -s ec2-user
sudo -u postgres createdb ec2-user
```

The first command creates the user **ec2-user** and the second one creates the database for this user because every user needs its database.
Even if the first command fails, run the second command to create the missing database.

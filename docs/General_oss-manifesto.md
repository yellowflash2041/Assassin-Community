# Building a Massively Open Community-Driven Company

The Practical Dev (https://dev.to, @ThePracticalDev on Twitter) is a new and tiny, but undeniably interesting company built on ideals of openness and honesty with a target of open-sourcing as much as possible. In this talk, we discuss why openness is such an amazing choice for us and speak about our technical roadmap to open source.

We have created a unique brand, built on humor and personality, engagement with community, and working out from there. Few technology companies establish a strong brand personality and engaged community before a line of code is written, but that was the story. We are a company built on opinionated commentary about software development and have established a large, captive audience in a short amount of time. It puts us in a position to grow the company with full input from the community every step of the way, as anyone who commits code is inherently a user of our services and member of the community.

The decision to make open source part of our DNA from the beginning will involve a lot of challenges. The speakers, Ben Halpern and Jess Lee, will discuss how we plan to address the challenges and leverage the opportunities.

Topics will include:

- Leadership in startups and in open source
- The benefits of diversity
- The current technology stack and our plans for the future, the need to balance being opinionated and open to new ideas
- The evolutionary nature of peoples' roles within a startup and open source project
- Making unpopular choices and saying no
- What it means to be open and honest in the digital age

Thank you for taking the time to read this proposal. It is an honor to be considered.


- Atypical approach to building the thing everybody thinks need to be build.
- Critical Node as an outsider
- Community-first development
- Shared ideology
- The talk will be an opportunity to lay an opinionated stake in the ground.
- Core team and satellites, ensuring community fairness. Openness in terms of moderation, making critical community-first choices from the beginning to ensure people of all backgrounds feel safe and appreciated in the community. Allowing ourselves to reimplement other ideas, knowing the differences can be subtle because we've staked our claim as an industry brand.
- Slow and asynchronous.
- Thirsty for the right kind of experience. In search of some buy-in from long-time developers who share in the vision.
- Notable personality differences between Ben and Jess is a critical strength of the founding relationship, but buy-in is critical. A diverse community willing to buy in will be amazing.
- What is unique about a wildly polyglot group of developers of all experience levels and how can we build a truly remarkable thing.
- When you're radically open source, there are challenges and expectations. You give up a lot, but you also gain a lot. We are a company willing to lay a lot out there for the benefit of the community. We will be the open meta company.
- It is dangerous to be open, but increasingly, it is dangerous to be closed. Privacy by obfuscation is hard to bank on.
- When a company's early growth strategy is the creator's humor, knowing how to leverage that and how to not fall into the trap of riding that too hard.
- Being open about the commercial intentions of this business, which were a hard thing to accept personally.
- The people behind open source
- Saying no to stuff is hard and it has a way of opening yourself up to criticism.
- Community comes to your defense when you have an engaged, open dialog with them.
- Blogging about some of the technical choices in the past has been huge for opening my eyes up to what the next step might be.
- You're allowed to make unpopular choices. You're better off being open about it. It's a feature, not a bug.
- Attention is cheap. Retention is everything. 15 minutes of fame. Bottle it. Are we a flash in the pan?
- There are already haters.

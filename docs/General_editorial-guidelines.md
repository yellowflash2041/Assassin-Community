# Editorial Guidelines for publishing on dev.to

### Don't get too clever with the title
Match the cleverness of the title to the tone of the piece and air on the side of descriptive, rather than poetic.

### Short pieces are fine!
You may be tempted to want to write a "full" blog post, but if you only need to write one paragraph, do that!

### Cover pictures are best for longer pieces
If it's short, simple, and technical, don't worry about picking a nice cover pic. If it's deeper and more high level in topic, go with an artistic cover image.

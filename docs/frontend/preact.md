# Preact

[Preact](https://preactjs.com/) is an alternative to React with the same modern API.

Preact components are packaged using [Webpacker](/frontend/webpacker) and the Preact code is located in `app/javascript`.

The components are mounted when needed, look for `javascript_pack_tag` in the view pages inside `app/views`.

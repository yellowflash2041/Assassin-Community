# Liquid Tags

Liquid tags are special elements of the [DEV Markdown editor](https://dev.to/new).

They are custom embeds that are added via a `{% %}` syntax. [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) is a templating language developed by Shopify.

Liquid embeds are for tweets, like `{% tweet 765282762081329153 %}` or a DEV user profile preview, like `{% user jess %}` etc.

They make for good community contributions because they can be extended and improved consistently. It is truly how we extend the functionality of the editor. At the moment, there could be a lot of work refactoring and improving existing liquid tags, in addition to adding new ones.

Liquid tags are sort of like functions, which have a name and take arguments. Develop them with that mindset in terms of naming things. They should be documented but also intuitive. They should also be fairly flexible in the arguments they take. Currently, this could use improvements.

Liquid tags are "compiled" when an article is saved. So you will need to re-save articles to see HTML changes.

Here is a bunch of liquid tags supported on DEV:

## How liquid tags are developed

Liquid tags are a matter of parsing the "arguments" and serving relevant JavaScript.

Liquid tags go in the `app/liquid_tags` folder. All liquid tags inherit from the base, like so...

```ruby
class KotlinTag < LiquidTagBase
```

Each liquid tag contains an `initialize` method which takes arguments and a `render` method which calls the appropriate view.

```ruby
  def initialize(tag_name, link, tokens)
    super
    stripped_link = ActionController::Base.helpers.strip_tags(link)
    the_link = stripped_link.split(" ").first
    @embedded_url = KotlinTag.embedded_url(the_link)
  end

  def render(_context)
    ActionController::Base.new.render_to_string(
      partial: PARTIAL,
      locals: {
        url: @embedded_url
      }
    )
  end
```

View files can be found in `app/views/liquids`.

Each new liquid tag should be accompanied by instructions in `app/views/pages/_editor_guide_text.html.erb`.

Liquid Tags should also be accompanied by tests in `spec/liquid_tags` which confirm expected behavior.

Some Liquid Tags are constructed using HTML and CSS within the app, and some are constructed by displaying an iframe of an external site.

CSS for Liquid Tags are found in `app/assets/stylesheets/ltags`. Liquid tag classes should generally be prepended by `ltag__`. e.g. `ltag__tag__content` etc.

Here is an example of a good Liquid Tag pull request... https://github.com/thepracticaldev/dev.to/pull/3801

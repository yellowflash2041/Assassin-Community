title: Configure Enviroment Variables

# Configure environment variables/secrets

Take a look at `Envfile`. This file lists all the `ENV` variables we use and provides a fake default for any missing keys. You'll need to get your own free [Algolia credentials](/backend/algolia) to get your development environment running.

The [backend guide](/backend) will show you how to get free API keys for additional services that may be required to run certain parts of the app.

For any key that you wish to enter/replace:

1. Create `config/application.yml` by copying from the provided template (ie. with bash: `cp config/sample_application.yml config/application.yml`). This is a personal file that is ignored in git.
1. Obtain the development variable and apply the key you wish to enter/replace. ie:

```shell
GITHUB_KEY: "SOME_REAL_SECURE_KEY_HERE"
GITHUB_SECRET: "ANOTHER_REAL_SECURE_KEY_HERE"
```

If you are missing `ENV` variables on bootup, the [envied](https://rubygems.org/gems/envied) gem will alert you with messages similar to `'error_on_missing_variables!': The following environment variables should be set: A_MISSING_KEY.`.

You do not need "real" keys for basic development. Some features require certain keys, so you may be able to add them as you go.

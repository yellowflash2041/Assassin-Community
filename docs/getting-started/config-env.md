title: Configuring Environment Variables

# Configuring environment variables and secret keys

Take a look at `Envfile`. This file lists all the `ENV` variables we use and provides a fake default for any missing keys. You'll need to get your own free [Algolia credentials][algolia] to get your development environment running.

The [backend guide][backend_guide] will show you how to get free API keys for additional services that may be required to run certain parts of the app.

To set up keys for your local instance of DEV, you'll need to create an `application.yml` file. You can do this by copying the file called `sample_application.yml` in the `config` directory:

```shell
cp config/sample_application.yml config/application.yml
```

Then, add each key you need to the `application.yml` file. For example, if you're setting up GitHub authentication:

```shell
GITHUB_KEY: "SOME_REAL_SECURE_KEY_HERE"
GITHUB_SECRET: "ANOTHER_REAL_SECURE_KEY_HERE"
```

(Don't worry, your `application.yml` file is ignored by git)

If you are missing `ENV` variables on bootup, the [envied][envied] gem will alert you with messages similar to `'error_on_missing_variables!': The following environment variables should be set: A_MISSING_KEY.`.

Only certain features require "real" keys, so you may be able to add them as you work on different areas of the application.

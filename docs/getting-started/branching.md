# Creating a Feature / Bug Branch

When you are working on a bug, feature or improvement, you will need to create a branch. For features or improvement you will create a branch as follows:

```
git checkout -b feature/that-new-feature`
```

For a bug branch you will do as follows:

```
bug/fixing-that-bug
```

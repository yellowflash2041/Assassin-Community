## ⚛ Front-End Development

There is some legacy code which is old school JS, but for all things new, [Preact](https://preactjs.com) is the where it's at. If you're new to Preact, check out their [documentation](https://preactjs.com/guide/getting-started). Also, consider following the [#preact](https://dev.to/t/preact) tag on [dev.to](https://dev.to).

### 👷‍ Building components

We use [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org) to develop components. It allows you to focus on building components without the burden of the whole application running. If you're new to Storybook, check out their [documentation](https://storybook.js.org/basics/guide-react). Also, consider following the [#storybook](https://dev.to/t/storybook) tag on [dev.to](https://dev.to).

To get Storybook running on your local:

* 📦 Run `npm install` or `yarn` to ensure all your dependencies are installed.
* 🏁 Run `npm run storybook` or `yarn storybook` to start Storybook.
* 🏗️ Start working on your component and see the changes in Storybook as you save.

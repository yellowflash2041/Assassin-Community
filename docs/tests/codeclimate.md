# Code Climate

We are using [Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/thepracticaldev/dev.to) to track code quality and coverage.

Code Climate will grade the quality of the code of every PR but not the entirety of the project. If you want to make improvements to the current linting rule, feel free to submit a PR to change it.

Fix any errors that Code Climate raises in your PR's build and strive to leave the code better than you found it.

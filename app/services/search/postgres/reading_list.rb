        # them right after if they lie outside the bounds of the `OFFSET`.

        # NOTE: [@rhymes] A previous version was implemented with:
        # `.tagged_with(tags, any: false).reselect(*ATTRIBUTES)`
        #
        # =>`.tagged_with()` merges `articles.*` to the SQL, thus we needed to
        #    use `reselect()`, see https://github.com/forem/forem/pull/12420
        # => `.tagged_with()` with multiple tags constructs a monster query,
        #    see https://explain.depesz.com/s/CqQV / https://explain.dalibo.com/plan/1Lm
        # This is because the `acts-as-taggable-on` query creates a separate INNER JOIN
        # per each tag that is added to the list, each new clause uses the `LIKE` operator on `tags.name`.
        # That could have been improved by by adding a GIN index on `tags.name`, see
        # https://www.cybertec-postgresql.com/en/postgresql-more-performance-for-like-and-ilike-statements/
        # and a similar discussion https://github.com/forem/forem/pull/12584#discussion_r570756176
        #
        # An alternative solution, as we don't need the `Tag` model itself, is to use
        # `articles.cached_tag_list` and the `LIKE` operator on it, this could be further
        # improved, if needed, by adding a GIN index on `cached_tag_list`
        # It seems not to be needed as this approach is roughly 1850 times faster than the previous
        # see https://explain.depesz.com/s/ajoP / https://explain.dalibo.com/plan/PZb

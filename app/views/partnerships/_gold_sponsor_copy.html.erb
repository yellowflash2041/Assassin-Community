<h1>Gold Sponsorship</h1>
<p>
🏆 The Gold Standard.  This is our highest level of community sponsorship, and we work with just three Gold partners each month.  Here are more details about our most substantial sponsorship package:
</p>

<h3>
  👀  Dedicated homepage logo + tagline placement
</h3>
<p>
  Your company will receive prominent logo and tagline placement directly on the DEV homepage, where it will be seen by hundreds of thousands of unique visitors each month.  This is the most prime real estate on the platform, dedicated just for our Gold sponsors.
</p>
<h3>
  🙌  Inclusion in our weekly newsletter, and the option to add a boosted article to every newsletter
</h3>
<p>
Each week, we send a newsletter to ~150k subscribed developers, seeing ~30% open rates for each issue.  Your logo and a short blurb will be featured at the bottom of each email.
</p>
<p>
As a Gold sponsor, you will have an exclusive opportunity to include one boosted article in each weekly newsletter.  This is an incredible channel to promote your work to a highly-targeted audience of passionate developers.
</p>
<h3>
  👋  Top real estate on the dedicated sponsorships page, including a full write-up
</h3>
<p>
  The dedicated sponsorship page lists all the organizations that support the community.  You will receive top placement, featuring not just your logo, but a full write-up that highlights your company and emphasizes the most important aspects of your company’s message.  It will stand tall amongst all other sponsors on the page.
</p>
<h3>
  💪  Prominent placement in our monthly sponsor-awareness thread
</h3>
<p>
Each month, we publish an awareness and recognition thread where we highlight the organizations that support the community.  You will receive the most prominent placement, including a full write-up about your product or service.  This thread will serve to drive major awareness, engagement, and positive association to your company.
</p>
<p>
It will also include a call-to-action to follow your organization directly in the post.

<h3>
  🏆  Special flair on your organization profile page
</h3>
<p>
As a Gold sponsor, you will receive special flair that lives on your organization page.  This visual cue will show the DEV Community and broader ecosystem that you are an important community supporter, providing a natural draw for increased engagement on the platform.  And, of course, you’ll have bragging rights and company pride knowing that you’re supporting a wonderful community.

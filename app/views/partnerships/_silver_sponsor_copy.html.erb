<h1>Silver Sponsorship</h1>
<p>
  Woohoo!  Thank you for generously supporting the community with a Silver Sponsorship!  Here are more details about the package:
</p>

<h3>
  👀  Logo placement along with a short blurb about your company on the dedicated sponsors page
</h3>
<p>
  As a Silver sponsor, you receive prominent placement on our dedicated sponsors page.  In addition to logo recognition, we will also write a blurb about your product or service.  This is a powerful combo of brand visibility and education about your company.  Be sure to leave notes in the sign-up form to help us know where to focus our messaging.
</p>
<h3>
  🙌  Logo rotation in our “sponsor awareness box” on the homepage
</h3>
<p>
  Each month, we publish an awareness and recognition thread where we highlight the organizations that support the community.  As a Silver sponsor, we will include your logo and a blurb about your company in the write-up.  This thread will serve to drive awareness, engagement, and positive association to your company.
</p>
<h3>
  👋  Logo placement + a short blurb in our monthly sponsor-awareness thread
</h3>
<p>
  Your organization’s logo will receive a spot in the rotating sponsorship awareness unit on the DEV homepage.  The unit is located in the left-hand sidebar, where it is visible to hundreds of thousands of monthly visitors.  The precise number of impressions your logo will receive depends on traffic to DEV, and the total number of sponsors currently supporting the community.
</p>
<h3>
  🏆  Special flair on your organization profile page
</h3>
<p>
  As a Silver sponsor, you will receive special flair that lives on your organization page.  This visual cue will show the DEV Community and broader ecosystem that you are an important community supporter, providing a natural draw for increased engagement on the platform.  And, of course, you’ll have bragging rights and company pride knowing that you’re supporting a wonderful community.

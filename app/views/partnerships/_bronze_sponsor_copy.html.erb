<h1>Bronze Sponsorship</h1>

<p>
  Thank you for supporting the DEV Community!  Here’s what to expect with a Bronze Sponsorship:
</p>

<h3>
  👀  Logo placement on our dedicated sponsors page
</h3>
<p>
  The sponsors page is the hub and authoritative list of all community sponsorships.  As a Bronze sponsor, you will receive logo recognition directly on this page.
</p>
<h3>
  👋  Your company will be mentioned in our monthly sponsor-awareness thread
</h3>
<p>
  Each month, we publish an awareness and recognition thread where we highlight the organizations that support the community.  As a Bronze sponsor, your company’s name will be listed as one of our benefactors.  This thread will serve to drive awareness, engagement, and positive association to your company.
</p>
<h3>
  🏆  Special flair on your organization profile page
</h3>
<p>
  As a Bronze sponsor, you will receive special flair that lives on your organization page.  This visual cue will show the DEV Community and broader ecosystem that you are an important community supporter, providing a natural draw for increased engagement on the platform.  And, of course, you’ll have bragging rights and company pride knowing that you’re supporting a wonderful community.

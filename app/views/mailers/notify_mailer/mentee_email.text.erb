Hey!

Let me get straight to the point: your mentor is: https://dev.to/<%= @mentor.username %>. We have had you two automatically follow each other, so you can find them on DEV Connect, and introduce yourself!

A few notes: 
- Every person is different so every mentor/mentee relationship is unique. We expect some mentorships to last longer than others and hope that at the very least, you’ll have made a solid new connection.
- We expect everyone to abide by our Code of Conduct: https://dev.to/code-of-conduct, especially in this setting. Should your mentor demonstrate inappropriate behavior, please contact us immediately.
- If you feel like this was a mismatch, or if your mentor is unresponsive after several days, let us know. 
- We highly recommend setting goals and expectations with your mentor from Day 1. 
- To help you all get started, we’ve put together some resources: https://dev.to/jess/mentorship-resources-19p0

Thanks again for participating in our program. 

Good luck!

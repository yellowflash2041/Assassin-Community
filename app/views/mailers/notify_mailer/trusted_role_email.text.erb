Hey <%= @user.name %>!

We are happy to let you know that your <%= community_name %> account has just been upgraded to "trusted" status.

This gives you the power to privately downvote content which is low quality or spam and harassment, alongside a bit of additional functionality to help ensure the success of the community. Anywhere you now see a shield on the site indicates a place you can go to join our community's crowd-sourced moderation initiative. 

You may occasionally receive notifications about optional moderation actions, but you can unsubscribe (<%= app_url(user_settings_path(:notifications)) %>) if you do not want to receive these notices.

For more information about what you can do as a "trusted" user, check out this page: <%= app_url("/community-moderation") %>

- <%= community_name %> Team

        <p><a href="https://www.manifold.co/?utm_campaign=dev.to_march&utm_source=dev.to&utm_medium=sponsorship">Manifold</a> is a marketplace for independent developer services. This means they provide a much less chaotic way of managing plans across various software service providers through a single dashboard. Before finding out about Manifold, we experienced this sort of convenience through other platforms, but always with a high amount of vendor lock-in that prevents it from being a long-term solution. Manifold is a brilliantly executed idea. We happen to also be users of <a href="https://www.torus.sh/">Torus</a> for managing keys in our dev process after one of the Manifold founders made <a href="https://dev.to/ianlivingstone/comment/7if">this comment</a> on a post.</p>

        <p><a href="https://triplebyte.com/?ref=devto_mar18">TripleByte</a> is a remarkably efficient job placement platform. So much about about landing at a great engineering org is having people in your corner during the process. TripleByte qualifies you through a series of their own interviews in order to champion for you. You'll understand once you take <a href="https://triplebyte.com/?ref=devto_mar18">the quiz</a>. It's a wonderful blind-spot-exposing experience.</p>

        <p><a href="http://goto.algolia.com/l/139121/2018-01-31/287fnc">Algolia</a>'s core product is extremely low-latency search which we make great use of on dev.to in a variety of ways. It powers our core search as well as the customization of your home feed based on the tags you follow. We have plans to integrate it elsewhere, as well. It has become one of the critical pieces of infrastructure for our whole offering â€” which, as you may know, is all about performance. <a href="http://goto.algolia.com/l/139121/2018-01-31/287fnc">Plus it's free to try</a>.</p>

      Hey there App Academy 👋
    </h1>
  </div>
  <div class="body">
      <p>Thanks for checking out <a href="https://dev.to">dev.to</a>, a community where programmers share ideas and help each other grow. We're a place to discover and create articles, have friendly debates, and make new connections and friends.<br>

      Anyone is welcome to share articles, questions, and start discussions.  You can also cross-post from your own blog (including setting the canonical_url)!<br>

      We're excited that the friendly folks at <a href="https://www.appacademy.io/">AppAcademy</a> have sent you our way.  There are a few ways you can get started on the site:</p>

      <h2>Create an Account</h2>
      <p>You can sign up by authenticating via Twitter and/or GitHub.  You’ll then be able to write an intro post, fill out your profile, and start following authors and tags.</p>

      <h2>Leave a Comment</h2>
      <p>A great way to start engaging with the community is by leaving a comment.  It can be as simple as “Great article” or “Thanks for sharing.”  Because the articles on dev.to are created by the actual author, you’re able to engage in an authentic two-way dialogue to ask questions and provide constructive feedback.  We've found that these exchanges tend to be much more positive and productive than the conversations that tend to take place on aggregators.</p>

      <h2>Write an Article</h2>
      <p>When you’re ready, consider writing an article of your own.  It doesn’t have to set the world on fire or be the hardest-hitting technical breakdown of all time, just sharing your experience and individual perspective can be terrifically helpful.  The act of writing is also very valuable both personally and professionally -- it helps force you to organize your ideas, and also showcases to future employers that you know how to communicate effectively on technical topics.<br>
      
      If you’d like some feedback on your draft, simply keep “published” set to “false” and send an email to <a href="mailto:yo@dev.to">yo@dev.to</a>.  We’d be happy to get in touch and give you some thoughts and advice before you hit publish.<br>

      Welcome to the dev.to community!  Please be sure to reach out via Twitter and/or email if we can ever be of help 😀
      </p>

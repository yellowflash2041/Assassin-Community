    <p>So, you've received a
      <a href="http://swagnets.com">Swagnet</a>.<br>Swagnets use the built-in magnets found in your laptop's display in order to stay put. That way, there's no residue and they easily pop on and off.<br>They're compatible with
      <b>Macbooks</b> and <i>some</i> PC laptops.</p>

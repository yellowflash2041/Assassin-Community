## Dropdowns

Dropdowns should have position relative to it’s trigger. They can be used for
some 2nd level navigations, contextual configurations, etc...

Dropdowns should not be bigger than 320px. Dropdown default padding should be
dependent on width:

- < 250px: 16px 251 - 320px: 24px

FYI: Dropdowns use “Box” component as background, with Level 3 elevation.

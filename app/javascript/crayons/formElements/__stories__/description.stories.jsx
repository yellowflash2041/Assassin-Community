      Because of accessibility most (ideally all) fields should have label

      Fields can also have optional description - between Label and Field
      itself.

      Fields can also have additional optional description, for example
      characters count.

    <h3>Fields with Checkboxes & Radios</h3>
    <p>
      Labels for checkboxes and radios should be placed next to the form
      element.

    <p>
      It is possible to group checkboxes or radios into logical sections.

# CTAs (Call To Actions)

Call To Action is an extension for `<Link block />` component therefore it inherits Link's props and configuration.
CTA is meant to be more prominent and visually heavy so use these cautiously.

## CTAs vs Links vs Buttons

The most important of these rules is that the `<CTA />` (or `<Link />`) and `<Button />` elements are assigned to appropriate respective tasks. 
That is: `<CTA />` or `<Link />` should be used where navigation is elicited, and `<Button />` where a non-navigational action is being invoked.
For example, a 'Submit' control on 'Sign in' view (form) would suit a `<Button />` because its job is to submit the form. 
However, 'Register' call-to-action—taking the user to a different form, in a different page or screen—would benefit from `<CTA />` or `<Link />` semantics.

Do not use `<Button />s` as navigational elements. Instead, use Links (or CTAs) when the desired action is to take the user to a new page.

## Usage

Under the hood, CTA outputs `<a>` element.

Call To Actions has slightly different UI than regular `<Link block />` as our intention here was to make these more prominent. 
`<CTA />` is basically a `<Link />` therefore standard link markup should be used, including an `href` (links omitting `href` attributes are not focusable by keyboard).

### Icons

Icon can be placed in front of a label to both clarify an action and call attention to a CTA.
By passing an object in `icon` prop, there will be automatically included `<Icon />` component.
By default, the icon itself won't be customizable. Icons within CTAs are hidden from assistive technology, so make sure your button has descriptive enough text, or is otherwise well-labelled (e.g. with `aria-label`).

#### Icon-only

There are certain instances where an icon will suffice in place of a text label, but use these cautiously.
Icon-only CTAs should always use clear and obvious icon, ideally accompanied by a title. Icon-only CTAs will require an `aria-label` to ensure they are understood by users of assistive technologies.

##### Fully rounded

In most cases, whenever we display icon-only CTAs we tend to make them fully rounded - use `rounded` prop for that.
Other than that please avoid customizing border-radius on CTAs.
